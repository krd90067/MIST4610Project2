Questions:

1) How have crime patterns changed throughout the years with different neighborhoods in the dataset?

Why this is interesting / meaningful:
Crime changes based on season, population shifts, and policing strategies. Understanding which neighborhoods have rising vs. falling crime rates can help agencies allocate officers, improve safety planning, and inform policy.

2) Which types of crimes occur most frequently near certain geographic locations, and how does crime distribution vary by area?

Why this matters:
Law enforcement and city planners need to know what kinds of crimes are concentrated where. For example, theft may cluster in commercial zones, while vehicle theft may cluster near residential streets.
